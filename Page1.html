The real problem
</h2>
<p>
<img class="pic1" src="images/gov.jpg">
The problem in this case is extremism and people not educating themselves 
on how our economy works. The U.S. runs of a specific type of capitalism
 called Oligarchic Capitalism. In this type, a small group of capitalists
 have taken over both the economic system and the political system. Because
 of this, the people at the top, called the Oligarchs, can bend and
 manipulate the laws and the different systems the country runs on for
 their own gain. because of this, their own personal goals may not line up 
 with everyone elses goals, causing political extremism. Russia also runs
 of of this type of caplitalism, however it is far more advanced than ours.

 fringe benifits </a> or benifits based off of the resources found locally,
 healthcare would greatly improve. Both of these, however, mean that 
 citizens would have to pay a bit more towards healthcare, around 18%.
 Even though it is a bit more, paying around 6% more in taxes is a lot 
 better than even more crushing debt on your shoulders.
