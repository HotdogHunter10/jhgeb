This country runs on cash, even though we are 
<a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org"> this many
 </a> trillion dollars in debt. In truth, free healthcare 
 is a complicated topic. We have to take insurance into account, and we 
 have to ensure that Doctors and Nurses get paid the correct wages. These 
 two things contradict each other. There is also no other country that has
 free healthcare. Look it up. There definatly isnt 43 other countries that 
 have figured out how to do this without making insurance agents and doctors
 pay for it. It's just too complactied of an issue for the entire U.S federal
 goverment to figure out. Stop spreading communist propaganda.

We are a free country

America is the free-est of the free. If I want to jump off the roof of my 
house with a plastic Wal-mart bag as a parachute- I am free to do so. Well, I'm 
free to do so until I land in the hospital against my will. At that point, I'm no 
longer free. At that point, I already have to pay the $1,200 dollar ambulance ride,
and $2,800 dollars per day on top of that. I can refuse medical treatment, but then 
I would be crippled for life. It's a trap between crippling debt and just being crippled.
About 4 in 10 adults cannot afford a hospital stay, so if they are in an accident that is
 out of their control, they may have to take out a loan. Loans can end life plans, 
 if that person was planning on moving, or startng a family, that could delay
 those plans, or completly end them. A blind man could see the problem here.

Also, most of the things said here are jokes, there are problems
 with the U.S healthcare system, however it is WAY more complicated 
 than I am making it out to be.
